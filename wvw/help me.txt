Installation:

1) 
- open up js/settings.js
- change the settings, SPECIALLY THE API KEY
- save and close

2)
- open OBS
- go to your scene
- add "Browser source", local, find the "rating difference.html"
- width: 300, height: 100 is good enough
- NOTE: turn OFF "shutdown source when not visible", or the rating counter will reset progress when switching scenes (if you do that)

3) Go play some games.

Want to customize this?

Go ahead. I did not make the API fetcher, but every other function is done by me and you can edit it as you wish.
If you need help doing this just contact me as instructed above.
